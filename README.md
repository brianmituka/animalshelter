# the animal shelter  
This site was created to enable rescued animals to find new  
people that can take care of them after the horrifying experience  
they had been through with their previous owners

## how it works
we rescue the animals from different places and then post  
their pictures on our main web page interested parties can  
can contact us if they want to adopt the animals  
the adoption comes at a price though. it's not free. the organisation  
needs cash for it's daily operations.
